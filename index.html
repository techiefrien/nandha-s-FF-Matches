          <h5 style="color:red;">All must follow this rule in Tournament </h5>

        Each Team is required to always maintain a minimum of 4 players in the team during the tournament,
         A Team has the option of adding one additional player who shall act as a substitute (“Substitute”). Tournament Officials have the right to disqualify any Team with an incomplete roster.
          Teams need to register a total of five players including the Substitute.

Each Team must designate one player as their captain when completing the online registration process (“Team Captain”). 
The Team Captain will be responsible for all Team communications with Tournament Officials. The Tournament Officials may rely upon any communications from the Team Captain as being made by all players on the Team. 
The Team Captain must always be a player on the Team’s roster. A Team may not change its Team Captain during a Tournament without the prior written approval of the Tournament Officials.

Before the start of the tournament, each Team must register its roster (including all Core Members and any Substitute) using the official website. No changes to a Team’s roster will be permitted after a Team’s registration has been processed without the prior approval of the Tournament Officials (including for changes due to sickness or any other.).

A Substitute may replace a player only between games during Tournament play. During Online Events, players may be substituted at any time between games.
 Tournament Officials reserve the right to approve or deny any request to add or remove a player from a Team’s roster based upon the eligibility of the player(s) involved and such request’s compliance with these Competition Rules and the Registration Rules. 
Tournament Officials also reserve the right to notify the participants in any upcoming Tournament of the details of any roster change request that has been submitted by a Team to Tournament Officials if such roster change has not been publicly announced.

The Team’s name and logo will be selected at the time of registration and must be updated on the website, team profile during the registration may not be changed at any time during the Tournament without the prior written approval of the Tournament Organizer
